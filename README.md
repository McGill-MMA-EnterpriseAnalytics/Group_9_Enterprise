## Modelling Result Analysis
We display the visualization of validation result, roc auc score, classification report and confusion matrix for 4 models respectively by using the function ```clf_score```. The visualization is more intuitive than numbers to show the results of cross-validation. Based on the output above, we can conclude that ```Random Forest``` generates the highest number of correct predictions regarding the game's outcome. The most contributing factors are outlined below:  
* ```goals``` 
* ```timeOnIce``` 
* ```shortHandedTimeOnIce``` 
* ```powerPlayTimeOnIce```
 
Based on cross validation of the Random Forest model, the accuracy score improves from 0.8438 to 0.8465 after the hyperparameters have been tuned. The detailed process is showed in Section 5.4.  

In Section 5.4, you can see that we choose to tune the hyperparameters: 
* ```max_features``` 
* ```n_estimators``` 
* ```min_samples_leaf``` 
* ```random_state``` 

The modeling output implies that decision-makers should focus on the top contributing factors such as number of goals, time on ice, number of shots handled on ice, power-play time on ice when judging the outcome of the hockey game with the first-period statistics. By leveraging the Random Forest model, users can utilize hockey game statistics to determine the gameâ€™s outcomes as to which team will win or lose after the first period. The model generates accurate predictions on sports betting over randomly guessing the outcome. Also, the model performance validates the proof of value and achieves the business objective to develop a predictive model with an accuracy score higher than 52.4% in order to break even.  

The system limitation is that Sports analytics is generally difficult to model with the best models performing at accuracy levels ranging from 50-70%. However, our model performs very well at the accuracy level of around 84%, which potentially faces overfitting issues. Our team will carry over investigating this topic in the second half of the course. 

## Causal Inference Result Analysis
For the causal inference analysis, the objective is to examine the difference between the outcome of the game between the treatment and control group. The outcome is a binary variable, which is to win or lose the game. The explanatory variables are a list of 22 numerical variables of game statistics for period 1. And the treatment here is the whether the team is home or away. It is understandable that this might not be a very suitable treatment in this case, which is due to data limitation. But for this project, this variable will be used as an example to demonstrate the difference in outcome of the game for groups who play at home and not at home.  

From various causal inference models, time on ice is the most important feature, following Number of Penalty Infraction Minutes and goals. From the Uplift tree and random forest classifier algorithms, time on ice and power play time on ice are the top two most important features. According to the average treatment effect score, teams who play games away will have greater chance to win the game compared to teams who play games at home. 

Overall, time on ice and number of penalty infraction minutes are significant factors that could impact the outcome of the game. And whether the team will play at home or away do cause a difference in the outcome. In future studies, alternative treatment variables such as a certain nutrition that athletes take, or the use of a new hockey equipment could be used for causal analysis. These factors could create an impact on the outcome and having results of such could provide critical judgements for hockey betting.
